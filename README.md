# Arduino-Based-PID-Control-for-DC-Motor-Positioning
This repository contains the code and documentation for an experiment conducted in the Control and Computing Lab at IIT Bombay. The experiment involved designing a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller to control a 12V DC motor using an Arduino Mega 2560. The goal was to move the motor 180 degrees from its initial position and achieve a rise time of 0.5 seconds with less than 10% overshoot. The motor's position was monitored using an inbuilt potentiometer, and the controller was designed to address a non-linear region in the potentiometer readings.

## Components Used

- Arduino Mega 2560
- 12V DC Motor
- Motor Driver
- Potentiometer (inbuilt in the motor)
- Miscellaneous wiring and power supplies

## Objectives

- Design and implement a PID controller for a DC motor.
- Achieve a rise time of 0.5 seconds and less than 10% overshoot.
- Handle non-linearities in potentiometer readings.
